# NQueensSpecial

This project is a special implementation of the N Queen's problem with an additional constraint that no 3 queens are in a straight line at any angle.
This is done by implementing the "Constraint Satisfaction Problems" algorithm defined in [Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) 

## Build and run tests
